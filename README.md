## 1. Abstract
  This project started as a basic project for segmentation of Putamen tissue in MSA patients. The image segmentation algorithm is based on autoencoder. Autoencoder is an unsupervised learning ai algorithm, and takes the form of transforming the dimension of input data and then restoring it back to its original state. By applying this, segnet allows the user to obtain the desired data by restoring only a specific part of the image, not the original image. As the train data used in the project, 240 256 Ã— 256 lung CT images and 27 were used for validation [1], and an accuracy of about 0.98 was obtained through learning of 100 epochs.
